# rcrd

rcrd is a tool I built to track habits, like exercise or drinking.

## Ideas

- If anybody starts using this seriously:
  - set up and force TLS
  - ping Heroku to keep it from sleeping || move to EC2
- Instead of date field, sliding date picker? (specific enough to choose hours out of yesterday, today, yesterday, general enough to choose last/next week?).
